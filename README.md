# NATHAN Console

## How it began

The NATHAN console was born from a desire to create something meaningful—for an incredible person: **Nathan Therrien**.

I met Nathan in high school. He was one of those rare people who naturally brighten the world around them. Always smiling, always the first to say hello, to crack a joke, to make everyone around him feel good. We shared the same class in our final year, and even then, I was amazed by his radiant energy.

After high school, life took us in different directions. But I kept following Nathan online—especially through his Facebook page, where he shares videos of his musical explorations. Because yes, on top of everything else, **Nathan is an outstanding musician** and a passionate synthesizer enthusiast.

One morning in year 2022, Nathan made a post looking for help with 3D printing and soldering. At that time, I was just diving into the world of programming, microcontrollers, and digital fabrication. I was eager to learn and build something real. The moment I saw his message, I knew: **this was the project I had been waiting for**.

Working with Nathan—someone I had admired for years—gave me the perfect opportunity to grow my skills while collaborating with someone truly inspiring. He would be part of the process: designing the sounds, shaping the ideas, and even learning to code. From the start, the goal was clear: **build something together that he could one day fully own**.

Since 2022, this journey has become a shared adventure. Today, I’m proud to present the first version of the console:
**NATHAN — Narrative Audio Terminal for Humans with Alternative Navigation**.

As time becomes more limited for me, my hope is to pass the torch. I want the community to take this project further—to make it bigger, better, and even more inclusive.
